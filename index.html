        <header>The Bird-Dog</header>
        <p>Sure, you may look a little funny doing it, but this variation on the plank challenges you to keep your back flat and stable. It goes to show that not all essential exercises are about clanging plates and bending bars.</p>
        <code><img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bird-dog-exercise.gif"></code>

        <header>Planks</header>
        <p>Planks are a core strengthening move that never gets old and there are seemingly endless variations (like side planks, pictured above) to hit every angle of your core. </p>
        <p>Planks are perfect for working your core in a way that keeps you injury-free and builds the flat six-pack you're after.</p>

        <header>Jackknife Situp</header>
        <p>Jackknife situps are a challenging twist on the classic move. If you feel like they’re easy, check your form and make sure your legs are straight. </p>
        <code><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/97/de/cd/97decdc21be9158093bd9ee1396ecaac.gif"></code>

          <li>Extend your legs out long and reach your arms above your head.</li>
          <li>Hover your arms and legs a few inches off the mat (still press your tailbone into the mat).</li>
          <li>Take a deep breath, and on your exhale lift your head and pull your arms and legs up into a V-shape (lift roughly 30-45 degrees away from the mat).</li>
          <li>On your lift, keep your legs straight and your arms parallel to your thighs.</li>
          <li>Lower back down to your starting position.</li>

        <p>The first port of call for any abs workout this is a must-do. By lifting your legs you place extra weight on the stomach muscles and reduce the momentum that could make this easier.</p>
